         "Psychic Crowdsourcing is a technique for harnessing the collective intuition of large numbers of people to answer questions and solve problems.\n\nThe basic idea is simple. Start with a question no one knows the answer to. Ask a lot of people this question. Due to intuition or psychic potential, there will be a very slight tendency for people to guess the correct answer. With a large enough group of respondents, that trend towards the correct answer will be clear."

At psicrowd.com we use Psychic Surveys to frame questions and collect responses from large numbers of people.
